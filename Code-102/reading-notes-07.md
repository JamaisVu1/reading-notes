**1. What is control flow?**

Control flow is the order a script is executed. Going from start to finish, but also taking into account the structure and how it would effect the order things are executed.

**2. What is a JavaScript funtion?**

A function is a part of the code that performs tasks. 
For example:
function pythagoras(x,y) {
    const rSquared = x ** 2 + y ** 2;
    return math.sqrt(rSquared);
}
That snippet defines the pythagoras function that would calculate rSquared, and return its value.
