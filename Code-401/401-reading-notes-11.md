Jupyter Lab is an advanced version of Jupyter Notebook, offering a more integrated and flexible user interface with features like file browsing and support for multiple notebooks.
Jupyter Notebook is simpler, focusing on ease of use with a straightforward interface for writing and running code in a linear, document-like format.

2. What are the main functionalities provided by the NumPy library, and how can it be useful in Python programming, particularly for scientific computing and data manipulation tasks?

NumPy offers high-performance numerical arrays and tools for scientific computing, making it essential for efficient data manipulation and calculations in Python.

3. Explain the basic structure and properties of NumPy arrays, and provide examples of how to create, manipulate, and perform operations on them.

NumPy arrays are fixed-size, homogenous collections for numerical data, allowing efficient storage and operations like arithmetic, aggregations, and slicing.
