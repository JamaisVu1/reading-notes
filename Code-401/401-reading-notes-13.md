# Reading Notes 13

1. Can you explain the basic concept of linear regression and its purpose in the context of machine learning and data analysis?

Linear regression is basically finding a straight line through a scatter of datapoints, and is important to finding relationships.

2. Describe the process of implementing a linear regression model using Python’s Scikit Learn library, including the necessary steps and functions.

import LinearRegression from sklearn.linear_model. Create a LinearRegression object and train it using the fit method with your training data. Then use plt.scatter to plot the points.

3. What is the purpose of splitting the dataset into train and test sets, and how does this contribute to the evaluation of a machine learning model’s performance?


Splitting the dataset into training and test sets helps test how well a machine learning model works. The training set teaches the model, and the test set checks if the model can handle new, unseen data. This makes sure the model is effective and not just memorizing the data.
