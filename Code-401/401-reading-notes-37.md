# Reading Notes 37

1. In the context of ES6 Syntax and Feature Overview, what are three key features introduced in ES6 that improve upon the previous version of JavaScript, and briefly explain their benefits?

ES6 added arrow functions for shorter function syntax, block-scoped variables with let and const for better variable control, and template literals for easier string handling. These make code easier to read and maintain in JavaScript.

2. After reading “Tailwind in 15 minutes,” can you describe the purpose of utility classes in Tailwind CSS and provide an example of how to use them to style an HTML element?

Utility classes in Tailwind CSS provide predefined styles for elements, enabling rapid styling without custom CSS. For instance, p-4 adds padding, bg-gray-200 sets the background color, and rounded-lg applies rounded corners. By combining these classes, developers can quickly style HTML elements without writing extensive CSS rules.

3. Based on “Why to use Next.js,” explain the main advantages of using Next.js for web development, and provide a brief comparison between traditional client-side rendering and Next.js’s server-side rendering approach.

Next.js makes websites faster and more visible to search engines by rendering pages on the server, while traditional client-side rendering relies on the browser to do this, which can be slower and less friendly for search engines.
