# Reading Notes 4

1. What are the key differences between classes and objects in Python, and how are they used to create and manage instances of a class?

A class is like a schema for making objects and an object is an instance of a class, classes are used to create multiple objects with similar characteristics.

2. Explain the concept of recursion and provide an example of how it can be used to solve a problem in Python. What are some best practices to follow when implementing a recursive function?

A recursive function calls itself to solve a larger problem by solving smaller instances of that problem. Best practices are defining a base case and managing resources.

3. What is the purpose of pytest fixtures and code coverage in testing Python code? Explain how they can be used together to improve the quality and maintainability of a project.

Pytest fictures are are data you want to share across tests, and provide reusability. Code coverage is ensuring that your tests have run all the code. Together they improve code quality and ensure the test suites are running through the entire codebase.
