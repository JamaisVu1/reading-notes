# Reading Notes 32

1. What are the key components and purpose of Django Rest Framework (DRF) permissions, and how do they help in securing an API?

DRF permissions decide who can access what in your API, keeping sensitive data safe and blocking unauthorized users. By setting rules for who can do what, DRF ensures only the right people can interact with your API.

2. In SQL, what is the purpose of the SELECT statement, and how would you use it to retrieve all columns from a table called ‘employees’?

The SELECT statement in SQL helps fetch data from a database, and to get all information from a table named 'employees', you use: "SELECT * FROM employees;".

3. Can you explain the role of DRF Generic Views and provide examples of their usage in building a RESTful API?

DRF Generic Views are handy tools for common tasks in a RESTful API, like listing, adding, updating, and deleting items, saving time with built-in functions. For example, ListCreateAPIView shows and adds items, while RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView deals with viewing, updating, and deleting individual items.
