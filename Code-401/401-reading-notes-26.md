# Reading Notes 26

1. What are the key components of the Django framework, and how do they contribute to building a web application?

Django uses models for database work, views to handle what users see and do, and templates to create web pages. It makes building websites faster and safer with tools for forms, admin tasks, and security.

2. Explain the role of Djangoâ€™s MTV (Model-View-Template) architecture and how it handles a typical web request-response cycle.

In Django's MTV architecture, the model defines the database structure, the view processes web requests and interacts with the model, and the template renders the final webpage using data from the view. 

3. What is the purpose of Tailwind CSS, and how does it differ from Bootstrap CSS?

Tailwind CSS lets you build unique designs easily with utility classes, while Bootstrap gives you ready-made design elements for quick setup.
