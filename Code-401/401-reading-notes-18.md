# Reading Notes 18

1. What is the basic principle behind the Caesar Cipher, and how was it used historically?

Encrypting a message by shifting the alphabet a certain amount. It was used by Julius Ceaser to encrypt messages of military importance.

2. What are the key differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption? How is asymmetric used in secure communication today?

Symmetric encryption uses the same key for locking and unlocking data, making it fast but hard to manage in big groups. Asymmetric encryption uses two keys, one public and one private, making it safer and easier for lots of users, but it's slower.

3. How do computers generate random numbers, and what are the differences between true random number generation (TRNG) and pseudo-random number generation (PRNG)? Discuss their use cases in cryptography.

True Random Number Generators (TRNGs) use things like electronic noise to make completely random numbers, which is great for high-security tasks like creating encryption keys. Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs) use math formulas to make numbers that seem random but can be figured out if you know the starting point, and they're good for less secure needs.

4. Whatâ€™s the difference between encryption and decryption? Explain with an analogy.

Encryption is like locking a secret message in a box, while decryption is the process of unlocking that box to read the message.
