# Reading Notes 14

1. What are the key differences between Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh libraries in terms of their features and use cases? Provide an example of a specific visualization that is more suitable for each library.

Matplotlib: Good for detailed and complex static charts. Example: A bar chart showing sales over months.
Seaborn: Makes creating beautiful charts easier, especially for statistical data. Example: A heat map showing how two variables are related.
Bokeh: Best for interactive charts that you can use on the web. Example: A plot where you can hover over to see more data details.

2. In the Seaborn library, what are the main functions to create relational, categorical, and distribution plots? Briefly explain the purpose of each type of plot and provide an example use case.

Relplot() are used to compare two variables like height and weight.
catplot() shows data catagores like sales per game.
distplot() visualizes data spread like exam score distribution.

3. Discuss the role of the Seaborn Cheat Sheet in a Python developerâ€™s workflow. What are some key sections or elements featured in the cheat sheet that can help a developer quickly reference Seaborn functionalities?

It provides a quick reference when working with seaborn, like the catagorical plot section giving developers quick access to its abilities.
