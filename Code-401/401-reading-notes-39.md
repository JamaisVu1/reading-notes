# Reading Notes 39

**What is React Context, and how does it help in managing state and data sharing in a React application?**

React Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level, facilitating state management and data sharing across a React application.

**Explain the useContext Hook and how it can be used to access data from a React Context within a functional component.**

The useContext Hook in React lets components easily use and react to data from a shared context, simply by using the context's name in the component. This makes sharing data across many components straightforward, without passing props through each level.

**Describe the purpose of Next.js, and provide an example from the Vercel Next.js Examples reading on how it can be used to build a scalable web application.**
