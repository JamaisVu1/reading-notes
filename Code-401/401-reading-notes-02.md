# Reading Notes 2

## Testing and Modules

1. What are the key principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python, and how do they contribute to the overall quality of code?

Arrange, Act, and Assert. These steps present the data to be executed, then they execute the code and check if the output is what was to be expected. Following these steps saves the trouble of bug fixing in the future.

2. Explain the purpose of the if __name__ == '__main__': statement in Python scripts. What are some use cases for including this conditional in your code?

The '__main__': statement in python is used to check if the script is being run as the main program or being imported as a module. This is usful for testing.

3. Describe the concept of recursion in Python.

Recursion in Python is when a function solves a problem by calling itself with smaller versions of the same problem until it reaches a point where it can provide the answer.

4. What is the difference between Python modules and packages? Explain how to create, import, and use them in your Python programs.

 A module is a single file containing reusable code, while a package is a collection of modules organized in a directory. you make a module by saving code as .py . You import using "import".
