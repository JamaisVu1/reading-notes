# Reading Notes 1

1. In the context of the reading “Pain and Suffering,” describe the main challenges faced by beginners when learning Python and suggest at least two strategies for overcoming these obstacles.

- Being consistently pushed outside of your comfort zone, and dealing with the uncertainty of whether or not you'll make it the 10 weeks.

Working chow to chow always helped me, just making it from one meal to the next. Also, trusting that you're doing enough to make it.

2. After reading “Beginners Guide to Big O,” explain the concept of time complexity and space complexity.

Time complexity evaluates how the running time of an algorithm scales with the input size, expressed through Big O notation. On the other hand, space complexity measures the memory usage of an algorithm in relation to the input size, also denoted using Big O notation.

3. Based on the “Names and Values in Python” reading, explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types in Python.

In Python, mutable data types, such as lists, can be modified after creation, allowing for changes to their elements. Immutable data types, like tuples and strings, cannot be altered once created, ensuring their values remain constant throughout their existence.
