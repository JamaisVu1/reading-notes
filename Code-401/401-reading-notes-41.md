# Reading Notes 41

**Explain the concept of dynamic routes in Next.js and how they differ from static routes.**

Dynamic routes in Next.js enable creating pages with URLs that can change based on data, while static routes generate fixed pages during build time.

**Describe the process of deploying a Next.js application. What are the key steps involved, and what are some deployment platforms you can use?**

To deploy a Next.js application, you build it, choose a platform like Vercel or Netlify, upload your build, and check that it works.

**How does Next.js handle static file serving? Discuss the default folder structure for storing static assets and explain how to reference them in a Next.js application.**

In Next.js, you put static files like images and fonts in a folder called public, and to use them in your code, you just reference them by their filenames, making it straightforward to manage and deploy assets.
