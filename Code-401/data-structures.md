# Data Structures And Algorithms

1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

Consider the efficiency of operations required by the problem to choose the most suitable data structure.

2. How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

Ensure there is a base case.
