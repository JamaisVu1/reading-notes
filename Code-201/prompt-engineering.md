Bolognese sauce, also known as rag√π alla bolognese, is a classic Italian meat sauce that is commonly served with pasta. Here's a basic recipe for making Bolognese sauce:

Ingredients:

1 pound (450g) ground beef (or a combination of beef, pork, and veal)
1 medium onion, finely chopped
1 celery stalk, finely chopped
1 carrot, finely chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons butter
1 cup (240ml) whole milk
1 cup (240ml) dry white wine
1 can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes
2 tablespoons tomato paste
Salt and pepper to taste
1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
1 bay leaf
1/4 cup (60ml) heavy cream (optional)
Grated Parmesan cheese (for serving)
1-2 pounds of cooked pasta (like tagliatelle or spaghetti)
Instructions:

Heat a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Add the olive oil and butter.

Add the chopped onion, celery, and carrot to the pot. Cook them gently until they become soft and translucent, usually about 5-7 minutes.

Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute until fragrant.

Increase the heat to medium-high and add the ground meat. Break it up with a spoon and cook until it browns and any liquid it releases has evaporated.

Pour in the wine and cook for a few minutes until it mostly evaporates.

Lower the heat to medium and add the milk. Simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until most of the milk has evaporated.

Stir in the tomato paste, crushed tomatoes, bay leaf, nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it simmer for at least 1-2 hours, stirring occasionally. The longer you simmer, the richer the flavor.

If the sauce becomes too thick, you can add a little water to reach your desired consistency.

If you choose to use heavy cream, add it in during the last few minutes of cooking.

Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper as needed.

Remove the bay leaf and discard it.

Serve the Bolognese sauce over cooked pasta. Sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese.

Enjoy your homemade Bolognese sauce! It's a hearty and flavorful sauce that's perfect for topping pasta or even for layering in a lasagna.
