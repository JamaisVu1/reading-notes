# Reading Notes 6

The following are important to gaining a better understanding of JS.

## JS

1. How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?

    A object is like a box of stuff and the box has its own name, everything inside the box also have their own names. But you're still picking up just the box.

2. What are some advantages to creating object literals?

    It's easier to send an object than all the items in it.

3. How do objects differ from arrays?

    You can find things in an array based off the position, while an object you find them off the name.

4. Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.

   When the property name contains a character that doesn't work for dot notation.

5. Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?

    It refers to the dog. Using this refers to the current object and enables the same method across multiple objects.

## DOM

1. What is the DOM?

    The dom is an interface for web documents, it allows manipulation with javascript.

2. Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.

    DOM can be used with any language, it is not a part of JavaScript and is necessary for JavaScript to affect webpages and html documents.
