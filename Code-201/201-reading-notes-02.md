*HTML is the foundation for creating interactive webpages and applications.*

### Reading

1. Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?

Semantics give text meaning or roles, which allows the browser to display elements correctly.

2. How many levels of headings are there in HTML?

There are 6 heading elements, called with an h followed by the level number you want in ascending order.

3. What are some uses for the sup and sub elements?

Displaying algebraic formulas or chemical formulas correctly.

4. When using the abbr element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?

The title attribute must be added to provide expansion.

### Learn CSS

1. What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?

External CSS would be one file outside of the HTML file, called with the link element. Internal is placed in the head with the style element, and inline effects a single element.

2. Why should we avoid using inline styles?

Not only is it inefficient, but its ugly and hard to read.
